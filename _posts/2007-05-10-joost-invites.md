I just tried out Joost - the P2P Online TV.  Must say, am very impressed.

Not only at the variety of channels offered, but also the quality of the stream - mind you, a decent connection is a must.

A <a href="http://www.pantsland.com" title="Brad Kellet" target="_blank">friend</a> of mine I did notice that given some more unpopular channels, such as Poker - WPT, there does seem to be some intermittent dropping of video. Although this is a given, since this is only a BETA - and not all users are saturating the pipes yet.

Speaking of pipes. I noticed that having Joost running grabs at least 80-100kb/s on average, which must be the reading ahead that it does.

Unfortunately I was unable to run Joost when having no Internet connectivity. "Obviously" some will exclaim, yet the reason I wanted to try it - is, if I want to pre-buffer say an episode of FifthGear Porche review and watch it on the train on my way home, as I currently do with my Media Centre and it's recorded programmes. Well no can do. Perhaps it's something that might come out in the final release (am not holding my breath).

I enjoyed the experience, so should everyone else. If you're short of an invite, drop me a line.
