It is no secret that Google wants to be 'the' company of the millennium and beyond, especially with it [Google] <a href="http://e-caremanagement.com/connecting-the-dotsgoogle-health-promises-to-create-and-dominate-next-generation-phrs/" title="Google and Medicine" target="_blank">courting medicine</a>. Without a doubt that you will within 10 years see Google as the dominant force in ALL advertising, be it your fridge, washing machine, television and the soon to be supposedly unveiled <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/08/03/google-getting-more-serious-about-the-gphone/" title="GPhone" target="_blank">GPhone</a>.

Although what does this mean for the likes of Apple? Who just recently unveiled the much sought after <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/" title="iPhone">iPhone</a>. Will the company that lives and breathes innovation and the 'betterment' of your personal computer experience come under fire from those at Googleplex?

Google's strategy is great, and I applaud its flawless execution. They design and develop a great search engine, and with the profits buy their way into each and every foreseeable industry - thus not limiting themselves to the cash-cow that is AdWords. With each acquisition they will 'Googlify'/tweak it to the users. Where to from here?

The Romsturdamus Predictions:
<ul>
	<li>Products
<ul>
	<li>GPhone</li>
	<li>GNav [incar navigation]</li>
	<li>GOOS [Google Online OS - online/web]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>At first it will be the iPhone, and the trampling of the market-share of Apple</li>
	<li>It is always about the actual hardware design as it is about software; at the moment, the TomTom 'package' - is simply the best, software and units.
<ul>
	<li>Either Google will partner up with TomTom (especially now that most of the maps provided to Google in Europe are owned by TomTom's <a href="http://www.teleatlas.com/WhyTeleAtlas/Pressroom/PressReleases/TA_CT015133" target="_blank">recent acquisition</a> of TeleAtlas), or buy them out. Simply doesn't make sense to have TomTom produce units with Google's GNav software on it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Last but not least, GOS - Google Online Operating System. Sooner or later this too will happen, and what will happen to the incumbents such as Apple and Microsoft?</li>
</ul>
