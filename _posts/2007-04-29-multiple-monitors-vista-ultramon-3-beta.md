Am an avid supporter of multi-monitor set-ups. Once you end up using two or more screens - it's very hard to go back down to one.

----

At the moment my set-up consists of:

2x <a href="http://www.samsung.com/au/products/monitors/tft/940b.asp">Samsung 940B</a>'s
1x IBM/Lenovo <a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/ThinkPad_Advanced_Mini_Dock">Advanced Mini Dock</a>
1x T60 [<a href="http://ati.amd.com/products/MobilityRadeonx1400/index.html">ATI Mobility Radeon x1400</a>]

Works quite well, as soon as it's docked, it recognises the two monitors (one plugged in using VGA, other DVI), and off it goes.

----

In Windows™, it's quite simple - plug in another monitor, and through Display Settings - select where each screen is relatively to the others.

Unfortunately, even in Windows Vista™ - 5th Version of the monolithic, GUI - OS [95,98, 2000,XP, ->Vista), it is has yet to cater for a spanning taskbar, one that would cross all monitors.

That and other shortcomings are fixed by a nice program called <a href="http://realtimesoft.com/ultramon/">UltraMon</a>™. It allows for a multitude of features concerning multiple monitors. One's that I use:
<ul>
	<li>the spanning taskbar</li>
	<li>Windows Title Bar</li>
<h5>Puts icons near the close button of the window, that allow you to quickly with a click, move the windows to another monitor, or stretch it across all monitors </h5>
	<li>Wallpaper</li>
<h5>Finally - a tool which looks at setting distinct wallpapers for each screen, that is easy to use, and is persistent across reboots as well as docking/undocking my T60</h5>
</ul>

Now with UltraMon™ 3 Beta - you can finally use it in Vista™.

Several problems though:

<ul>
	<li>Docking the laptop </li>
<h5> Causes multiple taskbars to be rendered on the secondary display </h5>

<li>Freezing whenever some applications are launched - ie. <a href="http://filezilla.sourceforge.net/">FileZilla</a></li>
</ul>

With all these, am still a hapy camper, and absolutely love the app. Just hope they hurry up, and release the final.
