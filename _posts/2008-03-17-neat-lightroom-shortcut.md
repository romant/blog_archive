Ever wanted to hide the left+right pane's within Lightroom without having either custom defined shortcuts, or modifying OS X keyboard preferences to enable function keys?<!--more-->

Can't believe I stumbled onto this shortcut, as its exactly what I wanted to do. You see,  I didn't want to disable the multimedia keys as defined by default in OSX - as it would lead me to having to hold Fn to do one-key thing such as volume. So I went about pressing everything I could - and by mistake I came upon the following shortcut.

<code>
Fn + Tab</code>

Which hides both - your left and right panes.

Quite useful for both development view [at least until Adobe decides to provide secondary monitor support], and grid view.
