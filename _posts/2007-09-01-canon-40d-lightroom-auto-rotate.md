Cameras these days record the orientation of the camera when you take a shot, and write this into EXIF which is embedded into the photo. There seems to be a new way in which the 40D does it.<img src="http://blog.romant.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/lightroom-import-40d.jpg" alt="Adobe Lightroom 40D Auto rotate" />

If anyone has attempted to import from 40D into Lightroom, they might notice that all the images are rotated 180%.

Windows picks up the correct way up, yet Lightroom simply doesn't.

I hope Adobe will be quick to remedy this problem, as well as update the RAW converter to accommodate the 40D
<h3>Update</h3>
Having a further look into it - I noticed this only occurs when you connect the camera directly to the computer, as opposed to extract the CF, and using it within a reader.

Also windows didn't automatically rotate the photos when looking at them through explorer, so possibly this is a Windows Vista problem, and not Lightroom.

If anyone in XP or OSX can reproduce this - do post.

<h3>Update 2</h3>

After trying this with Lightroom 1.3 - the issue still persists.

Not fixed yet.
