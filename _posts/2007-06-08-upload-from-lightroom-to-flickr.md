If you fit into the following criteria, this post is for you.
<ol>
	<li>a fan of Adobe's Lightroom</li>
	<li>you happen to be a Flickr user</li>
	<li>you haven't seen the light and you're using Windows</li>
</ol>
You might want to know how to actually upload directly from Lightroom and into Flickr.
<h3>Step 1</h3>
Locate the  install directory for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/tools/" target="_blank">Flickr Uploadr</a>, mine resides in

<code>C:\Program Files\Flickr Uploadr</code>
<h3>Step 2</h3>
Locate where Lightroom places its export actions.

At the bottom you should notice:

Now paste the Uploadr exe into that directory.

Next time you attempt to Export - you will have the option of choosing Flickr Uploadr [as you can see I already have], and voila!
<h3>Note</h3>
<ul>
	<li>You might want to save this as a preset, so you wouldn't have to select Flickr Uploadr in the drop down all the time.</li>
	<li>Deselect 'Put in Subfolder' - so it would ONLY export to Flickr</li>
	<li>Best of all - all the tags that you already have, will be uploaded to Flickr, so don't worry about adding them in the Uploadr [<small>am getting sick of spelling it like that...</small>]</li>
</ul>
